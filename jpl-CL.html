                My last internship at JPL was an incredible experience, and I'm eager to return and build upon that momentum as I continue graduate school. JPL's mission of scientific discovery is vital for the world, and my experience working directly on a flight mission (CADRE) renders me well-equipped to take on new challenges.
            </p>
            <p>
                During my time with CADRE, I fulfilled a variety of roles to support vehicle verification and validation. My initial responsibilities were primarily systems engineering-focused, operating vehicle testbeds in both a laboratory setting and the Mars Yard. A critical focus during these tests was electrostatic discharge (ESD) safety, an essential awareness for future robotics projects. As my internship continued, I also supported integrated testing of the flight vehicles themselves.
            </p>
            <p>
                While the hardware testing was rewarding, my most significant contributions to CADRE were through software development. Early on, I identified bottlenecks in test procedures that could be addressed with new software tools and took the initiative to realize them. I wrote several scripts that enabled manual command sequences to be executed automatically, interacting with F Prime to send commands and receive responses.
            </p>
            <p>
                I also developed a user application for visualizing and editing the rovers' mapping data, which had previously lacked a user-friendly interface. This application, almost like a custom image editor, allowed maps to be drawn by users, setting specific starting conditions on the rovers for test drives. After drive tests were completed, the generated maps could be loaded by the application for review. This was an effective debugging tool for the flight software, and several specific bugs in the map creation algorithms were identified using it. While structured similarly to a full-stack application, it used an uncommon technology stack of Python and C++ with minimal UI libraries, reducing additional dependencies of the CADRE codebase.
            </p>
            <p>
                Going forward, I'm most interested in continuing down the path of user-facing applications. I'm particularly attracted to the work of the 347K Robot Operations group with the Robot Sequencing and Visualization Program (RSVP), used by Mars 2020, and the work done in data visualization by division 3900. However, I'm open to exploring any team for which I might be a good fit, including more robotics-focused projects.
            </p>
            <p>
                The sense of community and collaborative atmosphere at JPL is unlike anywhere else I've worked. In addition to expanding my technical skillset, I intend to become more involved with JPL's outreach programs, as showing CADRE to tour groups was some of my internship's most fulfilling moments, and inspiring the public is why we do what we do. As JPL continues to push the boundaries of science and technology, I'm eager to do my part in ensuring the future becomes a reality.
