                I'm thrilled to see fall internships opening up at Zipline. As I transition between undergraduate and graduate studies, I'm eager to gain real-world, private-sector experience at a place working for the good of humanity. I'm confident that my relevant experience would make me a valuable member of Zipline's Perception and Autonomy team.

                During my past internship at NASA, I was responsible for the complete lifecycle of an autonomous robotic system. Starting from a high-level mission concept, I performed everything from focused coding to broader system integration. Like Zipline's drones, my vehicle assessed its environment and charted a safe path toward its goal. Over the course of my internship, I both wrote custom pathfinding software and leveraged existing open-source frameworks. And while not at the embedded level, I worked directly with robotic hardware, performing frequent hardware-in-the-loop tests in an analog lunar environment. These tests enabled me to focus on the system's most critical flaws and perform efficient iteration. To ensure my project's longevity, I also produced documentation and operating procedures for reference by future interns.

                My university projects have also focused on robotic perception. My introduction to robotics involved using computer vision to recognize and track an object in real-time, and my current project involves obstacle avoidance on a 3D surface to plan surgical incisions. Working at Zipline would capitalize upon these experiences while developing new skills, such as working with Rust, using new types of sensors, and building software-based simulations.

                Aside from the technical aspects, I'm eager to work somewhere with a higher sense of urgency than my experiences in government and academia. Zipline's ongoing work in the medical field has saved countless lives while developing expertise in the competitive last-mile delivery market. I'm sure that Zipline's greatest achievements are yet to come, and I'd jump at the opportunity to help realize them.
