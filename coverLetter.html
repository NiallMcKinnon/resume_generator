                I'm thrilled to see entry-level positions at Boeing that suit my background. I've been passionate about space and aviation from a young age, and contributing to Boeing's vast array of projects would fully realize that passion. I'm confident that my real-world experience would make me a valuable member of the Boeing team.

                During my past internship at NASA, I developed mission-critical software for a hardware-focused system. I implemented the entire software stack for an autonomous vehicle, performing everything from focused coding to broader system integration. Throughout development, I performed hardware-in-the-loop tests of both individual components and the integrated vehicle. These tests allowed for efficient, iterative development that fulfilled the project's goals when I closed out my internship. And while I was solely responsible for my vehicle, it was one element of a larger mission. Open communication kept my entire team on the same page, ensuring all our components ft together. I also mentored those teammates less experienced with software, helping them elevate their capabilities instead of merely giving issue-by-issue fixes. Robust documentation ensured that others understood my work and that it could be continued by future interns.

                Since then, I've continued taking on new challenges. During my final semester of school, I completely overhauled a surgical path-planning codebase from an unreliable proof of concept into an object-oriented, robust API. I've also expanded my skillset through projects in web development and database construction. This summer, I've been offered a temporary internship at Kennedy Space Center focused on software testing, gaining more real-world experience with real consequences.

                I understand that this opening encompasses a variety of projects and teams. While I am particularly interested in Boeing's spaceflight projects, I am open to exploring other areas that align with my skill set. In any case, I am confident that Boeing provides an ideal environment for leveraging my existing experiences and challenging myself on impactful projects.
