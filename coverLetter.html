            <p>
My last internship at JPL was an incredible experience, and I'm eager to return and build upon that momentum as I continue graduate school. JPL's mission of scientific discovery is vital for the world, and my experience working directly on a flight mission (CADRE) renders me well-equipped to take on new challenges.
            </p>
            <p>
                I'm confident that my diverse background and skillset would enable me to hit the ground running and be a valuable member of Boeing's team. Throughout my internships, I've tackled a variety of software problems including traditional application development, robotic source code, unit testing, and automation. I also have hands-on experience in systems engineering and hardware-software integration, working directly with flight hardware.
            </p>
            <p>
                This range of experiences has made me incredibly versatile, allowing me to seamlessly assimilate into existing projects while tackling new challenges. During my most recent internship at the Jet Propulsion Laboratory, I was initially assigned a systems engineering, hardware-focused role. However, I quickly identified bottlenecks that could be addressed with innovative software tools. Taking the initiative, I spearheaded new software projects that not only streamlined my initial assignment but also significantly benefited the overall development of the mission.
            </p>
            <p>
                I thrive in a fast-paced, dynamic environment with a "the show must go on" attitude, and I'm eager to bring this energy and adaptability to Boeing. In the defense industry, second place often means vulnerability, so the detail-oriented, tight-schedule mindset I aquired during my time at NASA is directly applicable. Boeing's employee culture also aligns with my interests, such as the BOEALPS mountaineering employee group, which I'd intend to join and take full advantage of the beautiful scenery out west.
            </p>
            <p>
                Thank you for your time and consideration. If you have any questions, please reach out via phone or email. I look forward to hearing from you soon.
            </p>
            <p>
                Sincerely,
            </p>
